// Overleaf project snapshot which can drift slightly from the patch's base
// (the native mirror copy). A wide `expected` then fails to match, the patch
// silently does not apply, and the derived post-write content collapses to the
// un-patched paragraph. Reviewing-mode undo uses this content to decide
// whether the editor is still at the post-write state; when it is wrong, undo
// refuses its safe paths and the Codex-written paragraph is not reverted.
// Narrow token patches hid the bug: their tiny `expected` windows still match

// so the operation carries `verifiedContent`; the post-apply derivation must
